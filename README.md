## 🌃 The Mission
In the digital shadows, scammers are evolving. Generic blockers aren't enough. **ScamSherlock** is a high-fidelity, "Urban Noir" themed security dashboard designed to transform everyday users into digital detectives. Whether it's a suspicious SMS from "the bank" or a bulk list of links in a corporate email thread, ScamSherlock intercepts, analyzes, and reports.



## 🛠️ The Seven Pillars of Investigation
We have implemented 7 core functional modules, built for persistence and visual impact:

1. **The Scanner (Deep Analysis)**: Paste any URL for a deep-dive threat score and categorization.
2. **The Wiretap (Bulk Interception)**: A high-performance regex engine that extracts hidden URLs from walls of messy text.
3. **The Training Dossier (Intelligence)**: Interactive educational field guide teaching the "Hover & Intercept" technique and domain verification.
4. **The Detective’s Board (Analytics)**: Real-time statistical breakdown of personal scan history (Connected to Supabase).
5. **The Dispatcher (Reporting)**: Automated incident report generator for filing cases with the FTC and CISA.
6. **The Agent Profile (Gamification)**: A persistent XP and Badge system (localStorage) that rewards users for successful "Interceptions."
7. **SIGINT Monitor (Local Hotspots)**: A localized threat monitor focusing on "Ground Truth" data from our Raleigh, NC beta hub.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture
* **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript.
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom "Urban Noir" palette (Noir-bg, Trenchcoat Amber, Siren Red).
* **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for scan history and global threat persistence.
* **Visualization**: Recharts for dynamic threat velocity and composition analytics.
* **State**: Custom React Hooks with `localStorage` persistence for session-independent progress.



## 🕵️‍♂️ The Detective's Rank (Gamification)
We believe security is a habit, not a chore. Our **Agent Profile** system scales difficulty as you progress:
* **Rookie Informant**: Your first scan.
* **Field Agent**: 500+ characters processed.
* **Senior Detective**: Verified reports dispatched to authorities.
* *Achievement Badges include the "First Interception" and "Bulk Extractor" with glowing star indicators.*

## 📍 Why Raleigh?
For our Devpost submission, we chose to focus on **Ground Truth**. Our SIGINT Monitor tracks active intercepts from our current testing hub in **Raleigh, NC**. This ensures the data presented is verified, local, and impactful before we scale the network globally.
